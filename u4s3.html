      <h2>Linear Modeling and Logic Unit </h2>
  
<h4>4.3 Writing Equations of Lines</h4>
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>On August 5, 2010, a gold-and-copper mine collapsed in Chile, trapping 33 miners underground.  Rescuers used a drilling rig to reach the miners under the earth’s surface.  An escape capsule carried each miner up the shaft at a constant rate as shown in the graph.</p>

<p><img src="images/u4s3intro.png" alt="The Miner Rescue graph is a linear graph that is increasing from left to right. The x-axis represents the time in seconds and goes from 0 to 800 counting by 100. The y-axis represents the depth in feet and goeas from -2500 to 500. Two points on the graph are (0,-2050) and (680,0). "></p>

<ol>
    <li>At what underground depth were the miners trapped?</li>
    <p class="solution">2050 feet underground</p>
    <li>How long has a miner been ascending in the escape capsule when he reaches a depth of 300 feet?</li>
    <p class="solution">580 seconds</p>
    <li>How long did it take to bring each miner to the surface?</li>
    <p class="solution">680 seconds</p>
    <li>At what average rate did the escape capsule carry each miner up the shaft?</li>
    <p class="solution">\( \begin{equation} \frac{-300-0}{580-680}=\frac{-300}{-100}= \text{ 3 feet per second} \end{equation} \) </p>
    <li>Write an expression for the depth of the miner during his rescue with respect to time ascending.</li>
    <p class="solution">y = 3x - 2050</p>
