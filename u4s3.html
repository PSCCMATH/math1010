<p>On August 5, 2010, a gold-and-copper mine collapsed in Chile, trapping 33 miners underground.  Rescuers used a drilling rig to reach the miners under the earth’s surface.  An escape capsule carried each miner up the shaft at a constant rate as shown in the graph.</p>

<p><img src="images/u4s3intro.png" alt=""></p>

<ol>
    <li>At what underground depth were the miners trapped?</li>
    <li>How long has a miner been ascending in the escape capsule when he reaches a depth of 300 feet?</li>
    <li>How long did it take to bring each miner to the surface?</li>
    <li>At what average rate did the escape capsule carry each miner up the shaft?</li>
    <li>Write an expression for the depth of the miner during his rescue with respect to time ascending.</li>

</ol>
<ol>
<li>Use the graph “People With Health Insurance,” which estimates the U.S. population with health insurance in the given years, to answer the following questions.   
<img src="images/u4s3p1.png" alt="">
<ol>
    <li>How many people had health insurance in 1990?</li>
    <li>How many people had health insurance in 1991?</li>
    <li>At what rate is the number of people with health insurance increasing each year?</li>
    <li>According to the graph, how many people would you expect to have had health insurance in 1988?</li>
    <li>According to the graph, how many people would you expect to have had health insurance in 2014?</li>
    <li>The actual number of people in the U.S. with health insurance in 2014 was about 276 million.  Why do you think this differs from your estimate in question (e)?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Use the graph “Josh’s Car Trip” to answer the following questions.
<img src="images/u4s3p2.png" alt="">
<ol>
  <li>Is Josh traveling away from home or towards his home during his trip?</li>
  <li>How many miles long is Josh’s trip?</li>
  <li>How long does Josh’s trip take?</li>
  <li>What is Josh’s speed during his trip?</li>
  <li>At this rate, how long would it take Josh to complete a 3300 miles trek across the United States?  If he could only drive 8 hours a day, how many days would it take him?</li>
</ol>
<li>Use the graph “Demand Curve” to answer the following questions.
<img src="images/u4s3p3.png" alt="">
<ol>
  <li>When the cost of the product is $100, how many units are sold?</li>
  <li>When the cost of the product is $200, how many units are sold?</li>
  <li>When the cost of the product is $300, how many units are sold?</li>
  <li>Is demand increasing or decreasing with respect to cost?</li>
<li>What is the rate of change for units sold for every dollar increase?</li>
<li>Which brings in the most money:  selling the product for $100, $200, or $300?  (Take into account how many units are sold at each price)</li>
<li>At what cost does the demand hit zero?</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>Use the graph “Cost of Cell Phone by Number of Months” to answer the following questions.
    <img src="images/u4s3p4.png" alt=""> 
    <ol>
      <li>What two variable quantities are shown on the graph?</li>
      <li>Which is the dependent quantity?</li>
      <li>What is the domain as shown on the graph?</li>
      <li>What is the range as shown on the graph?</li>
      <li>What is the initial cost of the cell phone (at month zero)?  What might this amount represent?</li>
      <li>What is the cost of the cell phone at 12 months?</li>
      <li>What is the cost of the cell phone at 6 months?</li>
      <li>How much does the person pay towards his cell phone per month?</li>
      <li>Write an equation for the cost of the cell phone based on number of months?</li>
    </ol>

</li>
<li>
    Use the graph “Green Cab Vs Blue Cab” to answer the following questions.
    <img src="images/u4s3p5.png" alt="">
    <ol>
      <li>What two variable quantities are shown on the graph?</li>
<li>What are the units for the dependent quantity?</li>
<li>If your destination is 10 miles away, which cab would you call?</li>
<li>If your destination is 2 miles away, which cab would you call?</li>
<li>At what mileage does cost not matter when choosing a cab?</li>
<li>How much does the green cab charge per mile?</li>
<li>Write an equation for the cost of the green cab.</li>
<li>How much does the blue cab charge per mile?</li>
<li>Write an equation for the cost of the blue cab.</li>
