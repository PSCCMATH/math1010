                <p class="solution"> Jacob got the better raise.</p>
        </li>
        <li>12.	Last year a company made a net profit of $20,000 on sales of $1,000,000. This year they made a net profit of $40,000 on sales of $1,000,000. When talking to the shareholders, the company executives claimed that their profit increased by 100%, and asked for a bonus for doing so well. When talking to the union about a possible wage raise, the company executives claimed that their profit only increased by 2%, which hasn't even kept up with inflation. How did they determine these figures? Which one do you think is correct??
            <p class="solution"> The absolute change in profit is from $20,000 to $40,000 so it doubles.</p>
            <p class="solution"> The profit percentage is 2% last year and 4% this year so the percentage also doubles.</p>
