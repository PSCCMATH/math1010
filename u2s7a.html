      <h3>2.7a Measures of Central Tendency</h3>
<p>Students line up in order of age â€“ youngest to oldest.  Students are welcome to make up a birthday if they choose.</p>

<p>Find these measures describing the ages of students in the class:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Mode.</b>  The data set is the age of each student in years.  If no students are the same age, then there is no mode.  Or you might have bimodal or trimodal data.</li>

<li><b>Median.</b>  Count off from both ends to meet in the middle.  For example, have the two students on either end step forward, then the next two students on either end step forward until only 1 or 2 people are left in the back.  Average the ages to find the median if there are two middle students.  Then you as the teacher join the data set in the correct spot for your age and find the median again.</li>

<li><b>Midrange.</b> Add the ages of the oldest and youngest students.  Divide by 2.  Compare this to the median.</li>

<li><b>Mean.</b>  Have students count off to find the total number of items in the data set.  Then send a calculator down the line where each student enters their age and adds it to the running total.  Finally, divide the sum of all ages by the total number of students.</li>

</ol>

<p>Lead students to find some of these measures using their graphing calculators.  Students stay lined up, facing the classroom screen, each holding their own graphing calculator.  Show the calculator process on the screen as students follow your instructions.  Students enter the data set of ages in List 1 (L1) on their calculators and calculate the 1-variable statistics.  Students will be able to confirm the previous measures for the sum of all ages, mean, number of students, and median.  Demonstrate how to order L1 from least to greatest on the calculator to check for a mode.</p>

<p>For practice and discovery, ask students to find the same measures for these data sets:</p>

<ol>
<li>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9</li>
<li>5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5</li>
<li>1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9</li>
<li>1,2,3,4,5,5,9,9,9,9</li>
<li>1,1,2,2,3,5,9,9,9,9</li>

</ol>

<p>Which of the data sets have the same median?  Same mean?  Same midrange?</p>

<p>Complete the ACT scores activity.</p>
