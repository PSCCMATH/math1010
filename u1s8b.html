      <h3>1.8b The Interesting Thing About Interest</h3>
 <p>Ben and Arthur were friends who grew up together. They both knew that they needed to start thinking about the future. At age 19, Ben decided to invest $2,000 every year. He picked investment funds that averaged a 7% interest rate. Then, at age 30, Ben stopped putting money into his investments.</p>

<p><b>Now Arthur didnâ€™t start investing until age 40.</b> Just like Ben, he put $2,000 into his investment funds every year until he turned 65. He got the same 7% interest rate as Ben.</p>

<p>When both Ben and Arthur turned 65, they decided to compare their investment accounts. Who do you think had more?</p>

<ol>
<li>How much did Ben invest?</li>

<p class="solution"> $2,000 per year for 11 years = $22,000</p>

<li>How much did Arthur invest?</li>

<p class="solution">$2,000 per year for 25 years = $50,000</p>

<li>How much did Ben have in his account at age 30?</li>

<p class="solution"> \(\begin{equation}
    A=\frac{2000 \cdot\left[\left(1+\frac{.07}{1}\right)^{11 \cdot 1}-1\right]}{(.07 / 1)}= \$ 31,567.20
    \end{equation} \)</p>

<li>How much did Ben have in his account at age 65?</li>

<p class="solution"> \(\begin{equation}
    A=31,567.20\left(1+\cdot \frac{07}{1}\right)^{35}= \$ 337,029.78
    \end{equation} \)</p>

<li>How much did Arthur have in his account at age 65?</li>

<p class="solution"> \(\begin{equation}
    A=\frac{2000 \cdot\left[\left(1+\frac{.07}{1}\right)^{25 \cdot 1}-1\right]}{(.07 / 1)} = \$126,498,.08
    \end{equation} \)</p>
