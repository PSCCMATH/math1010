      <ol>
        <li>Julia feels like she needs to spring clean her house, but she also works full time so the time to complete her cleaning is limited. She has 25 items on her very detailed list of tasks and plans to accomplish one item on the list each day for the next few weeks. 
<ol>

      <li> After 3 days, how many tasks does Julia have remaining on her list?
        <p class="solution">22 tasks</p>
      </li>
      <li>Julia has been working on her list for 16 days. How many tasks does she still have on her list?
        <p class="solution">9 tasks</p>
      </li>
      <li>After one week, how many tasks are still on Julia’s list?
        <p class="solution">18 tasks</p>
      </li>
      <li>Choose a variable to represent the amount of time that Julia has been working on completing the items on her list and use this variable to write a rule for the number of tasks remaining on her list.
        <p class="solution">\(25-d\)</p>
      </li>
      <li>If Julia has only 6 items left on her list, how many days has she been working on her spring cleaning?
        <p class="solution">\(25-d=6\)</p>
        <p class="solution"> \(25-d-25=6-25\)</p>
        <p class="solution"> \(-d=-19\)</p>
        <p class="solution"> \(\frac{-d}{-1}=\frac{-19}{-1}\)</p>
        <p class="solution">19 days</p>

        <li>Rachel is planting a new dogwood tree in her yard. The tree is 12 feet tall now and expected to grow another foot every year. 

            
    
        <ol>
          <li>How tall will the tree be one year from now?</li>
          <p class="solution">13 feet</p>
        
        

          <li>How tall will the tree be five years from now?</li>
          <p class="solution">17 feet</p>
          <li>How tall will the tree be 15 years from now?</li>
          <p class="solution">27 feet</p>
          <li>Use a variable to represent the number of years from now, and write an expression to represent the height of the tree.</li>
          <p class="solution">\(12+y\)</p>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>A certain credit card company is offering its customers 5% cash back on all purchases made using their card during a calendar year. 
                <p class="solution">\(0.05x\)</p>
<ol>
  <li> If the amount of purchases you made using the card for the year is $24,000, how much will the company give back to you?</li>
  <p class="solution">$1200</p>
  <li>If you purchase fifteen thousand dollars of items using the card one year, what will the company give back to you at the end of the year?</li>
  <p class="solution">$750</p>
  <li>If you have received $60.00 back from the credit card company, what was the total amount of purchases you made using the card for the year?</li>
  <p class="solution">\(0.05x=60\)</p>
  <p class="solution">$1200</p>
  <li>If the company sent you a check for $1826.20, what is the total amount of purchases you made for the year on their card?</li>
  <p class="solution">\(0.05x=1826.20\)</p>
  <p class="solution">$36,524</p>

        <li>Daniel and his wife need to purchase a new water heater for their home. They have chosen to purchase a 65-gallon heater because of the size of their family. The water heater will cost $700. The cost for them to have the old water heater removed, the area prepared for the new one and the new water heater installed will cost them $90 per hour.
            <ol>
                <li>What quantities are important in this problem?
                        <p class="solution">Cost of new water heater, number of hours plumber works, plumber charge per hour, total cost of job</p>
                </li>
                <li>Which of these quantities are variable quantities?
                        <p class="solution">Number of hours plumber works,  total cost of job</p>
                </li>
                <li> What is the independent quantity?

                        <p class="solution"> Total cost </p>
                </li>
                <li> Why is this quantity called dependent?
                        <p class="solution"> The total cost depends on the number of hours the plumber works. </p>
                </li>
                <li>The units refer to how you will measure each of the quantities. What units will you use to measure the independent quantity?

                </li>
                <li>Define a variable that represents the independent quantity and use this variable to write a rule for the dependent quantity.

                </li>
                <li>If the plumber works for 2 hours, what did Daniel pay for the water heater and installation?
                        <p class="solution"> $880 </p>
                </li>
                <li>If the plumber works for five hours, what is Daniel’s cost?
                        <p class="solution"> $1150 </p>
                </li>
                <li>If Daniel is invoiced for $1285.00, how long did the plumber work?
                    
                </li>
                <li>If Daniel does not have to pay anything at all for buying and installing his new water heater, how many hours has the plumber worked? Does this answer make sense? Please defend your answer.</li>
