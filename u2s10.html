      <h3>2.10 The Normal Distribution</h3>

    <p>The normal distribution is the most commonly-used probability distribution in all of statistics.</p>

    <img src="images/u2s10intro1.png" width="400" height="400"  alt="A graph of a normal curve.  The number line below the curve is numbered from -3 to 3 counting by 1.  The graph is close to the number line on the left side of -3 and rises to a peak at 0 then goes back down close to the number line past 3. ">

<br><br><br><br>
<p>It has the following properties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bell shaped: most data values clustered near the mean, well-defined single peak</li>
      
        <li>Symmetrical: data values spread evenly around the mean, larger deviations from the mean become increasingly rare, tapering tails of the distribution.</li>
       
        <li>Has one mode (peak)</li>
       
        <li>Mean and median are equal; both are located at the center of the distribution</li>
      
       
    </ul>


    <p>Examples of things that are normally distributed.
      <ul>
        <li>Birthweight of Babies</li>
        <img src="images/u2s10introa.png" alt="A histogram of the distribution of Newborn Weights.  Frequency in thousands is labeled on the y axis and Weight in pounds is labeled on the x axis.  The y-axis ranges from 0 at the bottom to 160 at the top in intervals of 20.  The x-axis ranges from 6.7 to 8.5 in intervals of 0.1, with each bar of the histogram over one of the numbers. Each bar of the histogram gets higher from left to right until the middle of the graph when they go back down.  The bars are symmetric on either side of the middle bar.">
        <li>ACT Scores</li>
        <img src="images/u2s10introb.png" alt="A histogram of the distribution of ACT Scores.  Frequency in thousands is labeled on the y axis and the score is labeled on the x axis.  The y-axis ranges from 0 at the bottom to 160 at the top in intervals of 20.  The x-axis ranges from 13 to 31 in intervals of 1, with each bar of the histogram over one of the numbers. Each bar of the histogram gets higher from left to right until the middle of the graph when they go back down.  The bars are symmetric on either side of the middle bar.">

    <img src="images/u2s10intro3.png" alt="There are three graphs in the picture. All three graphs are of the same bell-shaped curve, a normal distribution curve. The x-axis shows the mean in the middle, the highest point of the graph. Three standard deviations to the left and to the right are also marked on the graph. So, the x-axis reads, -3, -2, -1, mean, +1, +2, +3. The first graph is shaded below the curve between -1 and +1 to show that 68% of all data in a normal distribution will be between -1 and +1 standard deviations from the mean. The second graph is shaded below the curve from -2 to +2 to show that 95% of the data in a normal distribution is between -2 and +2 standard deviations from the mean. The third graph is shaded below the curve from -3 to +3 to show that 99.7% of the data in a nomral distribution is between -3 and +3 standard deviations from the mean.">

    <p><img src="images/u2s10intro4.png" alt="The graph is a normal distribution curve very similar to the previous graphs. On this graph, percentages of data are shown between each standard deviation mark on the x-axis. The percentage between -3 and -2 is 2.35%. The percentage between -2 and -1 is 13.5%. The percentage between -1 and the mean is 34%. The percentage between the mean and +1 is 34%. The percentage between +1 and +2 is 13.5%. The percentage between +2 and +3 is 2.35%. These percentages represent the percent of data that lies between each of the standard deviations. For example, 13.5% of all data in a normal distribution are between -2 and -1 standard deviations from the mean."></p>
